# Few-shot Event-based Action Recognition

This is the official code repository for the paper **Few-shot Event-based Action Recognition**. In this repository, we will share our code and datasets to help the community better understand and reproduce the methods described in the paper.

## Datasets

- We will initially release publicly available datasets, with additional datasets and related information to be updated in the future.
- We will provide download links and usage instructions here as they become available.

## Code Release

- The code will be released at a later date, so please stay tuned for project updates.
- Feel free to raise any questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/eveleslie/Few-shot-Event-based-Action-Recognition/issues) section. We will do our best to respond promptly.
